# *Community Guidelines' Agreement*
*Also known as the Code Of Conduct, the Community Guidelines Agreement will provide a detailed explanation of what is and isn't allowed, in order to keep our community approachable and respectable.*

## *Section I: Our Pledge*
***1.1.*** *In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.*

## *Section II: Our Standards*
## *2.1. Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community*
***2.1.1.*** *The primary purpose of this community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member.*

- *Engage with consideration and respect;*
	- ***(Be welcoming and open-minded)***: *New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.*
	- ***(Be respectful)***: *Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.*
	- ***(Be empathetic)***: *Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make this a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.*
- *Contribute in a positive and constructive way;*
	- ***(Improve the discussion)***: *Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.*
	- ***(Be clear and stay on topic)***: *This community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions. (This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.)*
	- ***(Share mindfully)***: *When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads.(Additionally, don't share sensitive information. This includes your own email address. We don't allow the sharing of such information in this community, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users. If you'd like to invite other users to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link to the repository in which the project you are working on exists. By sharing the link to your project repo — with some information on what your project is and what kind of help or feedback you're looking for — you can invite others to collaborate with you via issues or pull requests without having to share your private information. You can also add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions to help you develop your project.)*
	- ***(Keep it tidy)***: *Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So, don’t start a discussion in the wrong category, don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions, don’t post no-content replies, don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share, and don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream. (Rather than taking an existing discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.)*
- *Be trustworthy.*
    - ***(Always be honest)***: *Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other community participants. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. Moderators will also be active in the community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help.*

## *2.2. What is not Allowed?*
***2.2.1.*** *Collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While you're in this community, you must comply with our use policies, which include some restrictions on content and conduct related to user safety, intellectual property, privacy, authenticity, and other limitations.

- ***(User Protection)***: *You must not engage in activity that significantly harms other users. We will interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole.*


*Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. Each of us is entirely responsible for their own actions.*

## *Section III: Enforcement*
## *3.1. What Community Participants Can Do*
***3.1.1.*** *If you see a problem, report it. Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this community. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police. When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time.*

***3.1.2.*** *Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement through [pedromiguelfilipesimoes@pm.me](mailto:pedromiguelfilipesimoes@pm.me). (All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly; All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.)*

## *3.2. Our Responsibilities*
***3.2.1.*** *Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with these guidelines, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.*

## *3.3. Enforcement Guidelines*
***3.3.1.*** *There are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble. Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation. We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using these guidelines to guide our decision. This means:*

  — ***3.3.1.1.*** *We optimize for code collaboration. We recognize that code can have multiple uses and we distinguish between how the code is being used on the platform and other possible uses. We also think about how our enforcement actions can affect a potentially complicated web of interdependencies across the platform and aim to restrict as little legitimate content as possible.*

  — ***3.3.1.2.*** *We take a human-centered approach to content moderation and we tailor our responses to meet the needs of a specific situation. Our team investigates the reports we receive on a case-by-case basis — considering context and the surrounding facts — before taking action. This could include taking into account potentially offensive content being posted in a way that lacks context or makes it easy for other users to unwittingly view or interact with. In those instances, we may favor moderation in order to safeguard our community.*

  — ***3.3.1.3.*** *Our decisions are rooted in our core belief that serving an interconnected community and empowering human progress through developer collaboration requires a commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging.*

*Where we have decided that moderation action is warranted, these are some of the ways we may respond by removing the offending content, blocking or disabling the offending content, downgrading the visibility of the offending content, hiding a user account or organization from public view, and/or suspending a user account from this community.*

*Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are not limited to:*

- ***Correction***:
	- ***(Community Impact)***: *Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.*
	- ***(Consequence)***: *A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.*
- ***Warning***:
	- ***(Community Impact)***: *A violation through a single incident or series of actions.*
	- ***(Consequence)***: *A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing these guidelines, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.*
- ***Temporary Ban***:
	- ***(Community Impact)***: *A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.*
	- ***(Consequence)***: *A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.*
- ***Permanent Ban***:
	- ***(Community Impact)***: *Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.*
	- ***(Consequence)***: *A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.*

## *Section IV: Scope*
***4.1.*** *These guidelines applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.*
